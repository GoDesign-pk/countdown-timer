# Project Description
We host a webinar every single day at 2PM Eastern. It is a pre-recoded webinar that plays daily.

On our landing page, we need a Javascript code to do this:

- Needs to display the next day @ 2PM Eastern. (For example: “Sunday, August 29th @ 2:00PM Eastern”)
- This needs to also show in their own timezone. (For example, “Sunday, August 29th @ 1:00PM Central”)

- There needs to also be a countdown to the next date.
